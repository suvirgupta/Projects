Project is to take world news data for the past 8 years and use it to predict the variations in the Stock price.

Data Consist of:

1.  Top 25 headlines are considered for a single date. (Range: 2008-06-08 to 2016-07-01) ranked by users.
2.  Stock data: Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is used to "prove the concept". (Range: 2008-08-08 to 2016-07-01)


Approach used here is:
To preprocess the data using NLTK library tokenize,removing stopwords, stemming, cleaning the news data
Vectorising the words using document term matrix(DTM). 
Try 1-gram, 2-gram, 3-gram.....n-gram vectors with increasing DTM size to get the optimum prediction with minimum memory usage

Since the world news has lot of redundant data normal regression techniques are ineffective on vectorized data.

So one has to use topic modelling technique to extract data related to financial crised and dates according to it.

Since any financial crisis does not happen in single day it can be carried over to months. Hence took document size to be monthly
rather than single day.

we used topic modelling techniques like LSA(Latent semantic analysis), LDA(Latent Dirichlet allocation) and even clustering techniques on 
the word vectors to get the cluster of words that are more linked to topic of finance.
we got better results with LDA using 17 , 20 clusters.

document names were according to the monthly dates as explained earlier. 
using LDA we can extract the dates that have high percentage of cluster having more of financial words.

Hence we manged to extract the dates like great ression of 2008, global crisis in chinese financial market 2011, Br exit

USED these dates extracted as an intervention in the ARIMA models for stock prediction 

first order differencing of the stock opening price give the variation close to these dates hence the dates can be used as 
a point intervention to our arima model.
