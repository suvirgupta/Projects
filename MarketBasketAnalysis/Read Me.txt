Using Python version 2.7.13

proprocessing steps are applied to 3 million user rows with partitioning for fast processing and transformation using spark.

There are three models that can be used to predict the sequential buying behaviour of customer

1. Matrix factorization model | link : https://github.com/suvirgupta/Projects/blob/master/MarketBasketAnalysis/Model.prediction.ipynb
Model Used is general recommendation engine (collaborative filtering)
library mllib.recommemdations , ALS(Alternate least square), Rating

Matrix that is feed to ALS to train for rating looks like
userid , productid and count
[[65538, 44359, 7],
 [65538, 9076, 1],
 [65538, 25072, 10],
 [65538, 47209, 6],
 [65538, 31343, 3],
 [65538, 21903, 1],
 [65538, 48416, 1],
 [65538, 34126, 1],
 [65538, 22935, 4],
 [65538, 22170, 7]]
 
 here each user and count of product id and no of times product is purchased in all transaction is present
 
 user to user * product matrix is built using count and decomposed to give lower dimention components of matrix
 
 matrix muliplication can be done of the decomposed component to get the recomendation for products or probabilty rating of purchase 
 for that product. But user product matrix is generic in nature and does not take into account sequential buying pattern
 I does not give user specific sequential results.
 
 
 2. Markov model | link: https://github.com/suvirgupta/Projects/blob/master/MarketBasketAnalysis/Markov_Chain.py
 
 Markov model takes into consideration user specific sequential buying behaviour with product to product transition matrix 
 for each user sperately as shown in the code in above link
 But the computation capacity of 50000*50000 product transition matrix is very high as it takes high ramcapability
 
 
 3. Miklov Model (word2vec)}| https://github.com/suvirgupta/Projects/blob/master/MarketBasketAnalysis/user.trans_vector.py
 using product in first transaction as in context to the product  purchased in next transaction and trainig a neural net model 
 with input as product id in the first transaction as output as the product purchses in the second transaction and so on to get 
 lower dimention vector repesentation of product ids that are user specific .
 
 one can find cosine similarity in between the product ids to find the closer product to be purchased in next transition.
