
COmparing count based vectorization model to probablistic model on movie sentiment analysis:

Glove and Word2vec claims to repersent semantic relation ship of words 
e.g 
Man- Woman
king - queen 
Above are semantic relation ship pairs will be equidistant in multidimentional vector space.
This relatinship is captured by above models

Project is to implement 3 different model of word vectorization using 3 differnt libraries in python.

Apart from that there are some other information and projects on ANN(logistic regression with parameter tuning using gridcv),
LSTM(time series prediction using stocastic model), CNN(dog cat image recognition)

Models for word vectoriztion:
1 BOW(bag of words)
2. word2Vec(CBOW(continuous bag of words), Skip Gram) 
3. Glove

Python Libraries used:
1. Gensim, Beautiful Soap, NLTK | Link: https://github.com/suvirgupta/Projects/blob/master/word2vec/Code2%20-%20Word2Vec.py
2. Tensorflow, NLTK, Beautiful soap (reference fro google tensorflow word2vec code)
